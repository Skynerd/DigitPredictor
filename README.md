# DigitPredictor

## Overview

**DigitPredictor** is a machine learning project built with C# that predicts handwritten digits (0-9). The user draws a digit on an interface, and the system recognizes and predicts which digit has been drawn using a pre-trained model.

## Demo

## Features

- **Real-time digit drawing**: Users can draw digits directly within the interface.
- **Accurate predictions**: The system uses a trained model to recognize and predict digits with high accuracy.
- **Simple and clean user interface**: Designed to be intuitive for all skill levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C# 100.0%
- **.NET Framework**: For the application and interface.
- **Machine Learning Framework**: (Specify any if used, e.g., ML.NET, TensorFlow for .NET, etc.)

 
## How to Use

1. Draw any digit between 0 and 9 in the designated area.
2. The system will process your input and predict the digit.
3. The predicted digit will be displayed on the interface.
